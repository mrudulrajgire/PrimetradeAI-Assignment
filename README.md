## 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes trading behavior data to extract actionable insights and build a predictive model that supports data-driven business decision-making.

The objective of this assignment is to:

- Perform structured exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Identify patterns and high-risk segments
- Build and evaluate a machine learning model
- Translate analytical findings into business strategy recommendations

## ⚙️ Methodology

### 1️⃣ Data Understanding & Exploration
- Inspected dataset shape, data types, and summary statistics
- Checked for missing values and inconsistencies
- Performed exploratory data analysis to identify trends and correlations

### 2️⃣ Data Preprocessing
- Handled missing/null values
- Encoded categorical variables (where required)
- Performed feature selection and transformation
- Applied train-test split for proper evaluation

### 3️⃣ Model Development
- Implemented machine learning model for prediction
- Evaluated performance using relevant metrics
- Interpreted feature importance for business understanding

### 4️⃣ Model Evaluation
Model performance was evaluated using:
- Accuracy / RMSE / F1 Score / AUC (as applicable)
- Confusion Matrix analysis
- Comparative performance insights (if multiple models tested)

---

## 📈 Key Insights

- Certain behavioral features strongly influence trading outcomes.
- High-risk profiles display distinct transaction patterns.
- A smaller segment of users contributes significantly to overall trading activity.
- Feature importance analysis highlights the most impactful predictors in the model.

---

## 🚀 Strategy Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

- Implement risk-based segmentation to monitor high-risk profiles proactively.
- Use predictive scoring to support trading decision systems.
- Focus on high-value user retention strategies.
- Introduce early-warning systems for abnormal trading behavior.
