📌 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing trading behavior data to uncover key patterns, identify risk indicators, and build a predictive model to support data-driven business decision-making.

The goal is to:

Understand customer/trading behavior

Identify high-risk or high-impact segments

Build a machine learning model for prediction

Translate findings into actionable business strategies

⚙️ Methodology
1️⃣ Data Understanding & Exploration

Loaded and inspected dataset structure

Checked data types and missing values

Performed descriptive statistical analysis

Conducted Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to identify patterns and correlations

2️⃣ Data Preprocessing

Handled missing/null values

Encoded categorical variables (if applicable)

Feature selection and transformation

Train-test split for model evaluation

3️⃣ Model Building

Implemented machine learning model(s)

Evaluated performance using appropriate metrics

Compared model effectiveness (if multiple models used)

4️⃣ Model Evaluation

Evaluation metrics used:

Accuracy / RMSE / F1 Score / AUC (as applicable)

Confusion matrix analysis

Feature importance interpretation

📈 Key Insights

Certain features significantly influence trading behavior and risk outcomes.

High-risk segments show distinct behavioral patterns compared to low-risk users.

A small percentage of users contribute disproportionately to trading volume.

Feature importance analysis highlights the most impactful variables for prediction.

🚀 Strategy Recommendations

Based on the analysis:

Implement risk-based segmentation to proactively monitor high-risk profiles.

Introduce targeted interventions for vulnerable trading segments.

Optimize decision-making by leveraging predictive scoring models.

Focus on high-value customer retention strategies to maximize revenue impact.
